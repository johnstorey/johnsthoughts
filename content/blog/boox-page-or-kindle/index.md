Recently -- March 2024 -- I decided to replace my 2013 era Kindle. Page turns now took 1 to 2 seconds to happen, and it could not run the latest software. In addition
I was on a quest to reduce the number of physical in my home. They were in double 
rows on every shelf, and stacks were accumulating on the floor. Time to get rid of
the ones I don't love. (In the end I still have nearly 1000 books in various 
formats, and 363 unread books in physical and electronic formats, but I did
get rid of 9 boxes of books, so progress!)

Since then I have responded to multiple posts on Reddit asking to compared the Onyx Book Page and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature edition. Since I had ordered both to compare them (and subsequently saw my wife take posession of the Paperwhite) I have some thoughts on the tradeoffs. Rather than continuing to repeat myself on Reddit I'll leave it here.

# Trade-offs Choosing the Onyx Boox Page over the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition

Before I explain why I chose the Page, let me say for 99% of consumers, I think the Kindle Paperwhite is the way to go. It limits itself to the features needed to be the perfect eReader and nothing else. I, however, wanted more.

## Pros to Choosing the Page

- It's an eInk Android OS tablet, allowing access to the Play Store to expand it's functionality if needed. This is limited, of course, to apps that work well on eInk, and run on Android 11, the older OS running on the Page.
- I enjoy turning pages with the buttons on the side. These are similiar to the Kindle Oasis (which seems to have been quietly discontinued).
- Libby (which connects your eReader to your local public library) is an available app, if with less than pleasing font choices.
- Moving files -- I am thinking of my hundreds of public domain ebooks -- to the device is simply a matter of opening an app on the Page, which starts a webserver. On my computer I browse to that URL and drag and drop files on / off the tablet.
- I am strangely amused to play YouTube videos on my eReader, even if that seems unlikely to become a large portion of my life.
- Using the Kindle app, once you set it to use the buttons to turn pages, is the same experience as a Kindle. There is one exception -- while you can highlight text, but the highlight color does not show on the screen. I understand why yellow does not display on eInk, but am surprised it's not translated to a shade of gray.
- The Page has a micro SD slot. I'm not sure why really -- it has 32 GB of storage onboard, and I don't see an eReader ever needing that much. But I guess I could transfer my whole eBook collection at once by putting it on a micro SD card.
- To my surprise I find the "navigation ball" useful -- or I did once I changed its settings.

## Downsides to Choosing the Page

- In some subtle way, if you put them side by side, the color of the Kindle screen looks better. But if it was not there I'd never notice. I was just comparing the two.
- There is a bit more friction setting up the Page. You can change tons of settings, but you need to go through them all to try to make it the way you want it. It's not overwhelming -- this is not an iPhone -- but it's friction. I had watched YouTube videos and already knew what I wanted to do before the device arrived.
- I think the Kindle screen feels less square, and more book like. That feeling quickly goes away when I am drawn into the story.
- The default epub reader on the device has some horrible font choice. Still this is basically a tablet so I am sure I will find an ereader, or settings, I prefer.
- I heard the Page only has a 5 year battery. My last Kindle was on its 11th year and still held a charge just fine. It just had slow page turns.
- It's looking like I will need to charge the Page weekly, not monthly like a Kindle.
- The Page does not come with wireless charging -- I would buy a $15 Qi charging adapter off of Amazon if I wanted that. That is what I did with the Kindle I am replacing. The Paperwhite Signature Edition comes with wireless charging built it.
- There are almost no cases for the Page. I ordered a felt one off Etsy, and there is the manufacturer's offical case. My wife had thousands of Kindle cases to choose from. So if that is an issue for you -- I seem many YouTube videos have people decorating clear cases for instances -- it might be a deal breaker.

## Downsides to both

- They collect data on you and send it to Amazon or China, respectively.

## Things I have yet to try

- Set up Libby.
- Find a better ePub Reader or find the setting I missed to make the current one a better experience.
- See if I can install Tailscale to access my hosted services at home while about. I have a vague idea of moving my book catalog from a spreadsheet to Budibase and checking it while shopping to avoid purchasing books I have. When I cataloged everything last week I found I had two copies of *Getting Things Done* and four different prints of Pablo Neruda's *20 Love Songs and a Poem of Despair*. This was clearly not optimal.
